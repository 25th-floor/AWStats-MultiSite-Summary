1. OVERVIEW
===========

What is and does AWStats MultiSite Summary exactly? Unlike other AWStats addons
this little tool summarizes multiple sites in a clear and compact way on a per
month and a per user basis.

It depends on the following AWStats settings for each site:

    AllowAccessFromWebToAuthenticatedUsersOnly=1
    AllowAccessFromWebToFollowingAuthenticatedUsers="user1 user2 user3"

and a seperate Apache VirtualHost (might work as subdirectory installation too)
to act as centralized AWStats "portal" (see "Apache Configuration" below).

To see a working online demo please go to:

    https://stats.25th-floor.com

and login as "awstats-mss-demo" with password "demo".



2. QUICK START
==============

The latest version of AWStats MultiSite Summary can be retrieved from:

https://github.com/25th-floor/AWStats-MultiSite-Summary/archive/master.zip

To install AWStats MultiSite Summary:

    cd /path/to/DocumentRoot
    unzip master.zip
    mv AWStats-MultiSite-Summary-master/* .

Additionally AWStats' "awstats.pl" has to be copied to
/path/to/DocumentRoot so AWStats MultiSite Summary can link to it from its
summary page. Creating a symlink might works too - depending on your
Apache/VirtualHost configuration.


2.1 Configure AWStats MultiSite Summary
---------------------------------------

Edit 'index.pl' and change the following values to suit your needs. Default
values are:

    my $awstats_config_dir = '/etc/awstats';
    my $awstats_uri        = '/awstats.pl';
    my $template_root      = '_system/templates';

NOTE: AWStats MSS (= the user your Apache is running as) needs read access to
      both the directory containinig AWStats configuration files and the
      corresponding "CacheDir".


2.2 Configuring AWStats
-----------------------

Besides a seperate AWStats configuration file for each site to be analyzed it
is strongly adviced to use

    awstats.model.conf

to configure default values and e.g.

    awstats.sitename.conf

to override these default values on a per site basis. Just add the following
line at the beginning of each site configuration file:

    Include "/path/to/awstats.model.conf"

As mentioned above for each site these parameters have to be set:

    AllowAccessFromWebToAuthenticatedUsersOnly=1
    AllowAccessFromWebToFollowingAuthenticatedUsers="user1 user2 user3"

User(s) defined here must be able to login on your AWStats "portal" (see
Configuring Apache below) via HTTP Authentication and will then get an overview
of all sites analysis he is allowed to access.

This way you can e.g. define a user who's allowed to access all available site
analysis.

If there's not more than one site configured for an authenticated users he will
be instantaneous redirected directly to the corresponding AWStats report.


2.3 Configuring Apache
----------------------

It is strongly advised that you create a seperate Apache VirtualHost as
centralized AWStats "portal" like e.g.

    http://stats.yoursite.com

Most important is however that you enable HTTP Authentication (Basic or Digest)
for the VirtualHost (or the Location/Directory if you prefer so). The users you
add to your UserFile (.htaccess, mod_auth_ldap, ...) have to be identical with
the ones you define in the respective sites' AWStats configuration file.

AWStats MultiSite Summary as well as AWStats itself are written in Perl so you
will have to enable CGI support for the DocumentRoot (see example VirtualHost).

An example Apache VirtualHost would look like:

    <VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80>
      ServerName stats.yoursite.com
      ServerAdmin webmaster@yoursite.com

      DocumentRoot /path/to/DocumentRoot

      ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/stats_yoursite.error_log
      CustomLog /var/log/httpd/stats_yoursite.access_log combined

      <Directory /path/to/DocumentRoot>
        AuthName "HTTP Statistics"
        AuthType Basic
        AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/auth/.stats.yoursite.com
        require valid-user

        Options +ExecCGI
        AddHandler cgi-script .pl
      </Directory
    </VirtualHost>

For information about how to create and maintain the AuthUserFile please see
the Apache documentation at

    http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_auth.html#authuserfile



3. HOW IT WORKS
===============

AWStats MultiSite Summary matches the authenticated user (HTTP Authentication)
with available site configuration files in e.g. /etc/awstats. If a match
occures it opens the file, reads some configuration values and tries to open
the latest corresponding AWStats cache file in "CacheDir" to get some values
for summarization.

If no cache file can be found (e.g. AWStats hasn't analyzed a site yet) the
site will not be visibile in the summary.



4. REQUIREMENTS
===============

AWStats MultiSite Summary has been tested with Perl 5.8.x and will most likely
work with all Perl5 versions.

Besides AWStats 6.x itself (earlier versions will work too eventually) the
following Perl modules are required and have to be installed. You can find them
all on CPAN (http://search.cpan.org):

    CGI
    File::Find::Rule
    File::Slurp
    Math::Round::Var
    Template Toolkit (see also http://www.tt2.org)
